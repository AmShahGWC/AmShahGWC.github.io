        <p class="margins tab1 search" style="text-align:left;">Iâ€™ve been at NEST+m since seventh grade. I am Moroccan, Filipino, Spanish, Chinese, and Indian. I am the older sister to a fourteen year old brother, which comes with a lot of responsibilities!  I am very hardworking, passionate, caring (ask any of my friends), creative and organized. I am the co-president of Spotlight Club, and have been a active member of over 10 clubs at NEST since my sophomore year. I love dad jokes, banana laffy taffy, Ratatouille, and good books. My favorite books are Neanderthal Opens the Door to the Universe by Preston Norton, I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, and, most recently, Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison. I also love music. I've been playing piano since I was in kindergarten, and have taught myself some guitar more recently. I also played flute in middle school, and hope to learn the drums. Some of my favorite music artists are Sufjan Stevens, The Beatles, Wings, Nirvana, Belle and Sebastian, David Bowie, Otis Redding, Nat King Cole, Phoebe Bridgers, Radiohead, Cocteau Twins, The Strokes, Tom Petty, Marvin Gaye, Jeff Buckely, Debussy, Prokofiev, The Velvet Underground, Toadies, The National, Pavement, Metallica, The Clash, Elton John, Weyes Blood, Elliot Smith, and more. I also love watching movies and tv shows. My favorite tv shows are the Big Bang Theory, The Office, Parks and Recreation, VEEP, Friends, The Gilmore Girls, Atypical, Stranger Things, Community, Arrested Development, and more. Some of my favorite movies are Licorice Pizza, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Whiplash, Shallow Grave, Ocean's 11, Stella Dallas, My Left Foot, Dead Poet's Society, and more.</p>
